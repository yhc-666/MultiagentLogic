  "We first define following predicates and corresponding natural language explanations:\nFurry($x, bool) ::: Is x furry?\nNice($x, bool) ::: Is x nice?\nSmart($x, bool) ::: Is x smart?\nYoung($x, bool) ::: Is x young?\nGreen($x, bool) ::: Is x green?\nBig($x, bool) ::: Is x big?\nRound($x, bool) ::: Is x round?\nWe have following known facts from the context:\nFurry(Anne, True) ::: Anne is furry.\nNice(Anne, True) ::: Anne is nice.\nSmart(Anne, True) ::: Anne is smart.\nYoung(Bob, True) ::: Bob is young.\nNice(Erin, True) ::: Erin is nice.\nSmart(Harry, True) ::: Harry is smart.\nYoung(Harry, True) ::: Harry is young.\nWe have following known rules from the context:\nrule1: Young($x, True) >>> Furry($x, True) ::: Young things are furry.\nrule2: Nice($x, True) && Furry($x, True) >>> Green($x, True) ::: Nice, furry things are green.\nrule3: Green($x, True) >>> Nice($x, True) ::: All green things are nice.\nrule4: Nice($x, True) && Green($x, True) >>> Big($x, True) ::: Nice, green things are big.\nrule5: Green($x, True) >>> Smart($x, True) ::: All green things are smart.\nrule6: Big($x, True) && Young($x, True) >>> Round($x, True) ::: If something is big and young then it is round.\nrule7: Green($x, True) >>> Big($x, True) ::: All green things are big.\nrule8: Young(Harry, True) >>> Furry(Harry, True) ::: If Harry is young then Harry is furry.\nrule9: Furry($x, True) && Smart($x, True) >>> Nice($x, True) ::: Furry, smart things are nice.\nNow begin reasoning to obtain all implied facts:\nUse rule1: Young($x, True) >>> Furry($x, True)\nBind $x to
